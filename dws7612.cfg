# For security reasons, you should setup a specific mysql-user for
# the logger and grant SELECT and INSERT rights to the specific database only.

# You may use the default database stucture by just executing the
# available script (dws7612.sql) on the corresponding mysql-host. If you do so, you
# do not need to edit the python script itself.

# If you wish to use your own database structure, the function '_log_data'
# needs to be modified accordingly.
